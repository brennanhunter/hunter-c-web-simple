# Hunter C - Portfolio Plan

## Inspiration from Top Portfolios

### What Works (from studying successful portfolios):
- **Content over flash** - Focus on actual work and results
- **Clear positioning** - Immediately obvious what you do and why you're valuable  
- **Real projects** - Show live sites, GitHub repos, actual impact
- **Clean typography** - Let the work speak for itself
- **Personality without gimmicks** - Show who you are without overdoing it

### Your Unique Angle
Unlike typical developers, you have:
- **Real business ownership** (Xtremery)
- **Multi-disciplinary skills** (games, coaching, repair, web dev)
- **Understanding of customers** (you've served real people, not just built demos)
- **Creative problem-solving** (game design background)

## Design Approach: "Refined Simplicity"

### Visual Style
- **Clean typography** - Good hierarchy, readable fonts
- **Subtle animations** - Gentle hover effects, smooth transitions
- **Whitespace** - Let the content breathe
- **Professional color palette** - Maybe keep that mint green as an accent, but toned down

### Color Palette (Xtremery-Inspired)
- **Primary**: Deep Navy (`#111827`) - backgrounds, main text
- **Accent**: Xtremery Purple (`#7C3AED`) - section highlights, headers
- **Secondary**: Xtremery Blue (`#1D4ED8`) - buttons, links
- **Highlight**: Aqua Spark (`#00FFD1`) - hover effects, CTAs
- **Background**: Off White (`#F9FAFB`) - clean sections
- **Typography**: Bebas Neue for headers, Inter/Open Sans for body

## Layout Structure: Simple & Effective

### Hero Section
- **Simple, clear headline**: "I build businesses and the code that runs them"
- **Brief intro**: 2-3 lines about your unique background
- **Subtle call-to-action**: "See my work" or "Let's talk"
- **Maybe one simple animation**: Text fade-in or subtle background gradient

### About Section
- **Your story in 2-3 paragraphs**: Business owner → Developer journey
- **What makes you different**: Understanding both sides of the equation
- **Personal touch**: Mention ADHD, coaching background, curiosity
- **Clear value proposition**: Why hire you over other developers

### Project Presentations
- **Lead with the problem** you solved
- **Show the solution** (screenshots, brief description)
- **Mention the tech** used
- **Link to live site/repo** if available

Focus on:
- ServicePro CRM (your SaaS success)
- A couple other solid projects
- Keep descriptions concise but impactful

## Technical Approach: Keep It Simple

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js** (what you're already using)
- **Tailwind CSS** (or just clean CSS)
- **Maybe Framer Motion** - but only for subtle stuff
- **Good typography** (Inter, Geist, or similar)

### "Cool Stuff" (Optional, Add Later)
- Smooth scroll between sections
- Gentle hover effects on project cards
- Maybe a subtle gradient background
- Simple fade-in animations as you scroll

## Content Strategy: "Developer Who Gets Business"

### Key Messages
- "Creative problem-solver who builds businesses AND code"
- "I understand what real customers need because I've served them"
- "From game design to web development to business operations"
- "Smart, scrappy, and brings real-world results to the table"

### Your Story
- **Multi-disciplinary background**: Game design, business owner, coach, developer
- **Problem-solver mentality**: "Figure-it-out energy" (love that from your resume)
- **Real business experience**: Built and run Xtremery, understand both sides
- **People skills**: Coaching background, former stand-up comic
- **Diverse projects**: From Unreal Engine games to local business websites

### Projects Section
**1. Xtremery** - "Built a real business from scratch"
- Before/after of the branding you created
- Business metrics if you can share them (customers served, growth, etc.)
- The website you built, customer acquisition system
- Tech: WordPress, local SEO, branding, business operations

**2. Game Development** - "Creative problem-solving in Unreal"
- Screenshots/videos of Dawn and Dusk, Shadow Mind
- Your role as lead designer, team management
- Technical challenges solved
- Tech: Unreal Engine, Blueprints, level design

**3. Web Development Portfolio** - "Custom solutions for real clients"
- Show 2-3 client sites you've built
- Focus on problem → solution → result
- Include performance metrics, user feedback
- Tech: Next.js, WordPress, custom development

Each project needs:
- **Live link** (if possible)
- **GitHub repo** (if public)
- **The problem** you solved
- **Your approach** and key decisions
- **Tech stack** used
- **Results/impact** achieved

## The Goal
Create something you can actually finish in a reasonable time frame, that looks professional, and showcases your work effectively. No blob animations required.

## Next Steps
1. Set up basic Next.js structure
2. Create simple, clean sections
3. Add your actual content
4. Polish typography and spacing
5. Add subtle animations if you want them
6. Deploy and iterate

Keep it simple, make it work, then enhance gradually.
